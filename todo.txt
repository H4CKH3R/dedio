- switch "wallpaper"
- random cool looking gui elements
- texture pack loader
- gamma editor (changes lighting)
- fov slider (DIFFICULT!) // we could scale the canvas and then do something with the zoom
- toggleable wasd detector thing (ykwim) // yeah, where you see the button clicks /// thats right, yeah
- wireframe? // wdym? | https://i.imgur.com/GoLZfPe.jpeg // without the enemies, just local player
- ***custom*** fps counter (allows changing colors and stuff through the menu)
- custom client keybinds
- fix skin color thing

- clan badges

Not really possible:

- GG button on killed (get name from kill menu) // not an element?! I have no clue how to do this, even querySelector wont work
- permanent small version of scoreboard // depends what you mean, might be possible if the javascript isnt randomized
- better tab scoreboard
- auto-gg setting (no need for button press) // how do we see if the user got killed?
- auto rejoin
- sreenshake (only with readable html and trees help)
