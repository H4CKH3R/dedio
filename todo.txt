- switch "wallpaper"
- custom gun skins
	-> library with skins and nice menu (in-game windows)
- auto rejoin
- random cool looking gui elements
- texture pack loader
- gamma editor (changes lighting)
- fov slider (DIFFICULT!) // we could scale the canvas and then do something with the zoom
- toggleable wasd detector thing (you know what i mean) // yeah, where you see the button clicks /// thats right, yeah
- wireframe? // wdym?
- keybind presets // wdym?
- sreenshake (only with readable html and trees help)
- "No Internet" screen (not that easy as i thought)
- ***custom*** fps counter (allows changing colors and stuff through the menu)

Done:

- functioning keyboard shortcuts (easy)
- GG shortcut
- hello shortcut
- splash screen
- fix styling

Not really possible:

- GG button on killed (get name from kill menu) // not an element?! I have no clue how to do this, even querySelector wont work
- permanent small version of scoreboard // depends what you mean, might be possible if the javascript isnt randomized
- better tab scoreboard
- auto-gg setting (no need for button press) // how do we see if the user got killed?
