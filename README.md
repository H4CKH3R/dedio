# Quasar Deadshot Client `BETA 1.0`

Introducing the most advanced and simultaneously user-friendly client for [Deadshot.io](https://deadshot.io/) that exists and will ever exist. Hopefully.

This client contains many unique features found nowhere else, such as a fully customizable Graphical User Interface, with many performance and cosmetic options. It also includes a completely easy to use skin and resource swapper to completely change the look and feel of your game. 

Never before such power has been instilled into a downloadable software client for a webgame. NEVER. Its just so goddamn awesome.

I highly encourage everyone to try it out. Truly a game-changing experience.
