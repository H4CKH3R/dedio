# Quasar Deadshot Client `PUBLIC 1.0`

Introducing the most advanced and simultaneously user-friendly client for [Deadshot.io](https://deadshot.io/) that exists and will ever exist.

This client contains many unique features found nowhere else, such as a fully customizable Graphical User Interface, with many performance and cosmetic options. It also includes a completely easy to use skin and resource swapper to completely change the look and feel of your game. 

Additionally, although there are many advanced features planned for the future, why wait? Download the latest version to try it out for yourself.

I highly encourage everyone to try it out. Truly a game-changing experience.
